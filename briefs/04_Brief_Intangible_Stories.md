# Intangible Stories
## Brief
Telling stories is something we do on a daily basis, we tell others stories about how our morning went, we tell stories about what we did last weekend, we tell stories about our pets, our families, our lives. Stories are descriptions of events, of happennings, yet they are often imagined as text. For this brief we shall attempt to tell interpret a story in an abstract, non textual way.

Pick a fairy tale or myth/legends that you like and bring it to the first session. We will work with the idea of iteration and experimentation to explore the ways in which we can tell a story.

At the end of this brief, you should have reimagined/retold the fairy tale of your choice into a piece of work and you will be giving a presentation about your work to the class. The piece of work should have a use in the telling of your story, either as a standalone interpretation of the story, a key visual aid, or a background set that the storyteller actively interacts with. You should employ interation and experimentation methods in the creation of youur final work.

## Preparation
- Pick a fairy tale/myth/legends that you like to work on to the first session, you can pick one from any culture you are familiar with.
- Please bring a pad of A4 layout paper, colour papers, scissors, pens, pencils, and any other materials you would like to work with to the first session.

## Audience
Children age 8-12 and their parents

## Deliverables
- a 5 minute presentation of your work. You should cover a basic summary of your chosen story, your research, process, final outcome, and reflection.
- A 2D or 3D piece, telling your chosen story in an appropriate and engaging way. You can use either physical computing or screen based tools to create your piece, the piece itself can be entirely physical, digital or a combination of the two.
- The work must have an interactive/active role in the telling of the story.
