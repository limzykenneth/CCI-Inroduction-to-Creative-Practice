# Daily Routine
## Brief
Routine is a sequence of actions that are regularly followed. Some people may have a daily routine, some may have a morning routine, some may be just a routine they follow when making tea. Find a routine that you follow in any aspect of your everyday life, it can be your goto breakfast, your commmute to college, or even the order in which you brush your teeth.

Taking that routine, you will first document it then visualize it. You can make the visualization an illustration, a comic strip, a set of instructions, or anything that conveys to the class something interesting or insightful (or even mundane) about your routine.

This brief will run for two weeks with the interim session a interim crit session where we will introduce the crit and practice talking about our work.

For the interim crit, you should have some ideas and prototype of what you want to create out of the routine you have chosen.

At the final crit during the last session, you should have finished your piece of visualization with all documentation and reflection.
