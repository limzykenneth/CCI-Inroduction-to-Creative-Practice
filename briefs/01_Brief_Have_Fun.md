# Have fun
## Brief
Festivals are celebrations, an event for people to be merry, celebrate, and be proud of their community and culture. Festivals are often fun and memorable. Your first foray into creative practice should also be fun and memorable. Working in groups, create a simple piece of creative work to the theme of "festival/carnival".

Outcome of this brief can be a drawing, a sculpture, a performance, a collection of objects, a poem, or anything that you think would convey the feeling of being at a festival. At the start of next week's session we will have everyone display what they came up with to the whole class and we will have some time to walk around and talk to each other about the work presented.

## Preparation
Please bring along a sketchbook, a pen, and whatever materials you would like to draw with (pencils, paints, coloured pens, markers, scissors, colour papers, etc).

## Schedule
#### 27 September 2019
- 09:30 - Introduction to Introduction to Creative Practice
- 10:00 - Briefing
- 10:30 - Workshop
	- In your group discuss what does a festival/carnival conjurs up (a memory, an image, a feeling, a temperature, a smell, etc.) and write/draw them down on the shared sheet of paper you have as a group (paper will be provided on the day).
	- Discuss as a group what are you going to make for next week's session. The work can be done collaboratively or you can split up individually but present your work together next week.
	- It can be useful to pick a certain aspect of festival/carnival that everyone in the group will respond to instead of going in different directions individually.
	- You are encouraged to start prototyping in this session and feel free to work in other spaces in the college as needed.
