# Translating a Scene
## Brief
Translation is the process in which text in one language is converted to another while preserving its meaning. Translation, however, can also apply to mediums of communication. A book can be translated into a movie (eg. Harry Potter), a movie can be translated into a video game (eg. Spider-Man 2, released 2004), and many other such examples. For this brief, we will explore methods in which we can translate a movie scene into another medium.

We will be introducing methods of conducting research in our creative projects in the first session which you will apply to the movie and scene you have chosen. We will review the research you have done in the second session.

For the second session, we will build on the research done and introduce a few methods for generating ideas.

At the end of this brief, you will have reinterpreted/translated the scene you picked into an interactive medium. You are expected to show the research you have done, the ideation process you have undertaken, documentation of your processes, and the final outcome of your work at the third session.

## Preparation
Pick a movie from the reference list below and watch it before the first session, pick any scene from the movie which you will be working with over the next two weeks. Bring some basic information about the movie you picked and also about the scene you picked to the first session (the year created, the director, the cinematographer, etc).

You will require a computer for this session.

## Audience
Cinema goers, movie fans
