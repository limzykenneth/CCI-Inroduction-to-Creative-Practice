# Algorithm
## Brief
Algorithm lies in the core of computing. All computations boils down to algorithm in one form or another, yet most algorithms are conceptually inaccessible to a big portion of the public.

For this brief, you will create a representation of algorithm that clearly communicates the nature of algorithm. You should choose a specific algorithm or a specific type of algorithm, for example: sorting algorithms, neural networks, or hashing algorithms.

Start by researching the particular algorithm that you want to take on, some algorithms are more complicated than others, you don't have to understand them fully at this point but aim to get to a point where you are capable of explaining to a layman what the algorithm does in words. For the final piece, you should aim to create an interactive explanation of the inner workings of the algorithm.

You should consider the audience, the nature & use case of the algorithm, the amount of details to include, and the effectiveness of your design when creating your work.

## Preparation
Read *On meta-design and algorithmic design systems* before coming to the first session.

## Audience
Portion of the adult public with a non-computer science background

## Deliverables
- Documentation of research, ideation, and process
- An interactive experience that explains the nature of your chosen algorithms
- Reflection
