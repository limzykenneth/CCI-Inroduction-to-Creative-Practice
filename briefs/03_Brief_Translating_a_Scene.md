# Translating a Scene
## Brief
Translation is the process in which text in one language is converted to another while preserving its meaning. Translation, however, can also apply to mediums of communication. A book can be translated into a movie (eg. Harry Potter), a movie can be translated into a video game (eg. Spider-Man 2, released 2004), and many other such examples. For this brief, we will explore methods in which we can translate a movie scene into another medium.

Choose a scene from one of the movies listed below. You should then thoroughly analyse said scene, in terms of production, semiotics, cienmatography, and relation to the rest of the story. For the final outcome, you should reinterpret/translate the scene you picked into an interactive experience. The experience can be a web page, a Processing/p5.js sketch, a physical interactive object, or in any other similar interactive medium.

We will be introducing methods of conducting research in our creative projects in the first session which you will apply to the movie and scene you have chosen. We will review the research you have done in the second session.

For the second session, we will build on the research done and introduce a few methods for generating ideas.

You are expected to show the research you have done, the ideation process you have undertaken, documentation of your processes, and the final outcome of your work at the third session.

## Preparation
Read *Task of the Translator* before coming to the first session.

Before coming to the second session, you should also watch [this Coding Train playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) (at least until part 5).

## Audience
Cinema goers, movie fans. Think about how the work you are creating can help them see the movie in a whole new way.
